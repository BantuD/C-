*deviation with pointer using [] and * both methods in deviation.cpp

* offset is like & when you want the address of a label

*when you want the value of a pointer you can write ptr[0] this will give you the value of the address where it is pointing to but you can use +value and -value to go forward and backward in the addresses which is based on (base +width*index)

*you can use * also to get the value from the data or *ptr = something to put some value to the address where ptr is pointing to 

*for traversing with * you can use () example *(ptr+index) this is same as p[index]
