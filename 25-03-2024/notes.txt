* not all the programing languages have true=1 and false=0 they have different actual meaning for it 

* its not an issue that th ecodding of the function is change unless the parameters keeps same 

*Modular says: Dont' pass separate parameters alwas pass the bundle that is something calleed data abstraction

*Data Abastraction: It is a modularization methodology (systamatic sytle) in which the data processed by a program is divided into smaller blocks known as objecys so that each object controls its own 
state(data) and supports its own behaviour(code).


*A class tells the object what data it should contain
* A class defines a set of members for a particular type of object and these members include fields(variables whose values indicate the state of that object 
along and methods(functions whose implementation describe the behaviour of the object.


* value of field describes the state of the object state is nothing but the data a method in an object which have the logic actually defines the behaviour of the object

* behaviour means function which is insid the object that means it is the behaviour of that object.

* our behaviour on our state (like suppose you're in angry state and somebody ask you for the money you won't give that is your behaviour/action

* in programing code is behaviour 


////Classes we have two type of the data in a class fileds(variables) and methods(functions) 

process making object out of the class is called activation

*making an object of the class is called activation or instantiation

*whenver you create an object class can decide the intial values of the fields using the constructors 


# can we pass the the indentity of an instance to an another insatnce so that we can call the beheviour/function of the first object behalf of the second object
like suppose i have a class which is containing all the mtehods and there is anothre class which is purely made out of fields just to store the data i want to call
method class
