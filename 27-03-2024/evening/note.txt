* A reference type (T&) automatically addresses the value of the variable with which it is
initialized and autmatically indirects to this value where ever it is used
Example: double Buy(Banner& info,int copies)

Banner b;


*With reference you can't move around the data which we can do in pointers

*with reference we need to garantee that the data must exist there we cant
have null reference

*Poeple uses the references just to avoid copy not manipulate the data 

referece example: 


*double Buy(const Banner& info, int copies):
->
tells that you can't use those methods who manipulate the states(fields) or (variables) of the array


*static filed variable:
#include<cstdio>

class Interval{                                                                                                                      
        public:

        private:
                int id,min,sec;
                static int count; // static field value is not stored in the instance 
};                                                                                                                   };                 

*copy constructor -> avoid exactly similar data like id in an object

data abstraction is finished today
