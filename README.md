 Create hello.cpp and converted it into assembly code with commands (cpp to assembly) and tried to compile but it says puts not found when we link it with system.o file

1. Used condition statements if else with the help of banner.cpp and used switches with the help of birthday.cpp

2. There are two ways of doing branching in c++ i) if else ii) switches
   switch cases are also slightly faster then if else

3. Something which go again and again is called iteration

4. Created count digit with 2 different algorithms i) div ii) mul
