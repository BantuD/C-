3. What is the significance of * when used with a pointer ptr?
    a) It indicates the address of the pointer.
    b) It retrieves the memory address pointed to by the pointer.
    c) It multiplies the value of the pointer by a given factor.
    d) It increments the pointer to the next memory location.

    b) It calculates the distance between two memory locations.
    c) It adjusts the position of a pointer within an array.
    d) It specifies the starting address of an array.

9. What is the purpose of using *ptr = something; in pointer manipulation?
    a) It assigns the value something to the memory location pointed to by ptr.
    b) It assigns the address of something to the pointer ptr.
    c) It increments the value stored at the memory location pointed to by ptr.
    d) It retrieves the value stored at the memory location pointed to by ptr.
